    <section class="main-text">
    <p><span>A</span>t the start of my twenties, I began immersing myself in a great deal of science/ non-fiction books.
        Authors such as Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan, Steven Pinker, Paul Davies, David Deutsch, Jacob Bronowski
        and others had imbued me with such an enthusiasm that I was helpless in getting entrenched in this world
        as much as I could. But however interesting these books are in themselves (and they are captivating), my enthusiasm
        had less to do
        with the collection of scientific facts than it did with the deeper implications being made underneath the surface.
    
    
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Scientific explanations often provide descriptions of things not merely unknown to the senses, but things that
        can only be described as completely alien to anything we experience on a normal day. If the idea is true
        that
        we gain knowledge from things we experience in the world, how could science come up with descriptions for things
        which we do not, or cannot, observe directly? 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The answer, as physicist David Deutsch puts it, is that scientists rely on different <em>modes</em> of explanation.
        This means that, instead of relying on observation to tell them what’s in reality, they rely fundamentally on their
        own creativity to find new ways, or modes, of explaining reality. This may seem counterintuitive to some, but this
        is how we gain powerful knowledge of things
        we do not observe.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    What drew me into this way of explaining things was a sense that if it were possible to describe things far removed
        from anyone’s direct experience, then it should be possible, in principle, to use these kinds of explanations to
        understand in varying degrees,<em>anything and everything</em>. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I do not mean that we should be able to memorize every fact about everything there is to know. I mean that we should
        be able to provide <em>theories</em> that allow for deeper understanding of everything we observe. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Some such theories already exist. Theories within fields such as physics, biology, computation, and even
        within philosophy allow for a kind of understanding that is distinguished from the regular use of the term. The
        reason why is because the best theories of reality that are currently available to us explain
        much more than what they were originally intended to explain. It is through this feature—an explanation’s
        <em>reach</em>— that we can come to understand the whole of reality with greater clarity.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The general public is not entirely congizant of this way if looking at reality. What is more is that it is, and has
        always been, actively fought
        against. It has become fashionable, for example, to believe that greater knowledge, and therefore greater progress,
        happens by the increasing specialization and fragmentation of our spheres of knowledge and professions. Or the
        belief that true understanding is impossible from imperfect beings such as ourselves, or that explainations take
        away the mystery that’s important for an exciting life. Or even the argument
        that we must cease trying to make progress because it’s destructive to the environment and ultimately ourselves.
        These, and countless other arguments are made to try and stop humanity from understanding reality via explanations.
    
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Having a look at how we have made progress in the past, we notice that all of our progress— scientific,
        technological, political, moral,
        philosophical— has been the result of deep and general theories about reality. This alone does not establish why we
        should continue to expect progress to come from our more general theories, but in looking at the reasons for their
        effectiveness, we will see that true understanding can only occur in the form of these kinds of general and deep
        explanations.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Due to this characteristic of how our knowledge grows, far from becoming further separated, our
        different fields of knowledge will increasingly become unified. From art, philosophy, music, and aesthetics, to
        physics, mathematics, psychology, and politics, as we move further into the future, our understanding of these
        subjects will
        become more closely linked. It is becoming
        more possible for the average person to understand reality like we wouldn't presently think possible. Such is the
        case
        now with respect to our ancient ancestors of only a few hundred years ago. The average person today contains a
        greater understanding of reality than a most learned person did in the 16th century.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    And so, the topics I will be covering here in the future will be in light of seeking good explanations. Explanations
        who’s reasons we can criticize and who’s implications are vast. We cannot expect to reach a stage of completion for
        our knowledge, as humans are imperfect and problems will always be present. But this, as I see it, is a cause for a
        great sense of joy and amusement. We will have much interesting work to do.

                <p>I look for underlying principles that govern reality. Our best theories in science and philosophy point
                    towards a unity of knowledge, and I believe that a greater apprehension of these explanations will lead
                    to a future
                    of unbounded growth. This site allows me to share my search with you.</p>
